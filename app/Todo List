1. Automatic location of the user based on gps location.

2. Making a local db, so that we do not have to make api calls for a location again.
Means We have to first search in our database and if not found, then making the api calls.
It will also make our app to fetch contents faster.

3. I am planning to use some map other than google maps for plotting directions.

4. Improving the UI of the app.

3. Collecting data. For eg: if toilet is available then is it for women or men?
