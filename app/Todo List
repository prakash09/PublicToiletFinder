1. Making a local db, so that we do not have to make api calls for a location again.
Means We have to first search in our database and if not found, then making the api calls.
It will also make our app to fetch contents faster.

2. Automatic location of the user based on gps location.

3. Collecting data. For eg: if toilet is available then is it for women or men?
